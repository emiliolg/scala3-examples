## sbt project compiled with Dotty

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[dotty-example-project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project/blob/master/README.md).

### You can open this project with Intellij

I've checkin the .idea directory because Intellij project creation for Dotty from sbt is not working as of today (Nov 11th)
